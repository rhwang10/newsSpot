# newsSpot

Welcome to newsSpot! This is an application developed in Vue.js, that I created to automagically link news articles from various sources to corresponding Reddit threads. This project is still in development. I will continue to add more functionality. See the notes below on how to setup the development environment. Those instructions will give you a copy of the project, and you can add features and continue to develop the web application.
